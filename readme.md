# Useful MU-Plugins for WordPress
### Useful MU-Plugins for ClassicPress

Modern WordPress, and to some extent, ClassicPress has too much annoying rubber padding for younger users.  
These plugins make some of these frustrating 'features' bearable.

## Description
Each PHP file is a plugin. Each doing one specific thing. The filename is kind of self-explanatory but each has a Plugin Description as well.

Each plugin is intended as a Must Use Plugin (Mu plugin) for WordPress and ClassicPress but can be used as a regular plugin as well.  
None of these has a dashboard or any settings. But if you know your way around PHP you can edit the files directly to probably set intervals or delays as you please. Look through the code to find the appropriate variables.

## Installation
1. Log in to your hosting space with (s)FTP/Webdav.
2. Navigate to the wp-content/mu-plugins/ folder. Create it if it doesn't exist.
3. Upload each plugin that you want to use.
4. Verify that the plugin is listed in your Plugins dashboard, in the Must-Use tab. Seeing it listed means it's activated.

-OR-

1. Log in to your hosting space with (s)FTP/Webdav.
2. Navigate to the wp-content/plugins/ folder.
3. Upload each plugin that you want to use.
4. From your Plugins Dashboard, activate the plugins as shown.

## Disclaimer
It should go without saying that you use these plugins at your own risk. I use them on my sites and they work for me. I believe they are useful for other users, especially advanced users, of WordPress and ClassicPress. Should anything go wrong, you loose data or your site gets compromised, that's your own responsibility.

If you have suggestions for improvements I'm keen to hear about it! Either start a discussion here on Github or use the contact form on my website. Thanks!
