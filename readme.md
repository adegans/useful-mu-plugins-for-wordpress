# Useful MU-Plugins for WordPress
### Useful MU-Plugins for ClassicPress

Modern WordPress, and to some extent, ClassicPress has too much annoying rubber padding for younger users.  
These plugins make some of these frustrating 'features' bearable.

## Description
Each PHP file is a plugin. Each doing one specific thing. The filename is kind of self-explanatory but each has a Plugin Description as well.

Each plugin is intended as a Must Use Plugin (Mu plugin) for WordPress and ClassicPress but can be used as a regular plugin as well.  
None of these has a dashboard or any settings. But if you know your way around PHP you can edit the files directly to probably set intervals or delays as you please.

## Installation
1. Log in to your hosting space with (s)FTP/Webdav.
2. Navigate to the wp-content/mu-plugins/ folder. Create it if it doesn't exist.
3. Upload each plugin that you want to use.
4. Verify that the plugin is found and active in your Plugins dashboard, in the Must-Use tab.
5. All done.
